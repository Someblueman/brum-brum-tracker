## Common Issues

### No Planes Showing?

1. **Check Your Location**
   - Make sure location services are enabled
   - You might be in an area with less air traffic

2. **Time of Day**
   - Early morning and evening usually have more flights
   - Overnight hours have fewer planes

3. **Weather**
   - Some weather conditions change flight paths

### Arrow Not Working?

1. **iPhone/iPad Users**
   - Make sure you clicked "Enable Compass"
   - Check Safari settings: Settings > Safari > Motion & Orientation Access (must be ON)
   - Try reloading the page

2. **Hold Device Properly**
   - Keep device relatively flat
   - Avoid magnetic interference (metal objects)

### No Pictures Loading?

- Some aircraft don't have photos available
- Images load from aviation databases
- This is normal for newer or rare aircraft

## Privacy & Safety

### What We Track
- We only know your approximate location to find nearby planes
- No personal information is collected
- The logbook is stored locally on your device

### Staying Safe
- Never point lasers or lights at aircraft
- Enjoy watching from a safe location
- Remember planes are very high up (usually 5+ miles!)

## Fun Activities

   - Find a plane from another continent
   - Catch a "Super Jumbo" (Airbus A380 or Boeing 747)

2. **Learning Games**

   - Learn airline codes (AA = American Airlines)
   - Count how many engines different planes have

3. **Family Competition**
   - Who can spot the most planes in an hour?

## Need Help?

If something isn't working right:

1. **Refresh the Page**: Often fixes temporary issues

4. **Report Issues**: Contact the developers through GitHub

## Have Fun!

Remember, every plane you see has hundreds of people going on adventures! Where do you think they're going? What stories would they tell?

Happy plane spotting!
